FORTRAN code, namelists and execution scripts of the phytoplankton community model SPEAD-3D (Simulating Plankton Evolution with Adaptive Dynamics in 3 spatial Dimensions)

The temporary version currently available (SPEAD3D_merge) is the version used to write the article submitted to Science in early September 2025 by Guillaume Le Gland, Boris Sauterey, Bingzhang Chen, Pedro Cerme√±o and Sergio M. Vallina.

The outputs of SPEAD-3D are global oceanic distributions of nutrients, organic matter, and plankton biomass and community composition.

The inputs necessary to run the model and the Matlab script necessary to analyse the outputs can be downloaded on the webpage of the Ocean Globe Laboratory (http://oceanglobe.info/FORTRAN/MITgcm_SPEAD3D/SPEAD_3D_archives_zipped.zip)
