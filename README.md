FORTRAN code, namelists and execution scripts of the phytoplankton community model SPEAD-3D (Simulating Plankton Evolution with Adaptive Dynamics in 3 spatial Dimensions)

The temporary version currently available (SPEAD3D-merge) is the most updated version.

The outputs of SPEAD-3D are global oceanic distributions of nutrients, organic matter, and plankton biomass and community composition.

The inputs necessary to run the model and the Matlab script necessary to analyse the outputs can be downloaded on the webpage of The Ocean Globe Laboratory:
